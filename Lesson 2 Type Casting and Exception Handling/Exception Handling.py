#While Exceptions have already been covered in the basic syntax file
#We shall be going over them in more detail in this section

#Some Examples of errors are
#while True print("Hello World") #Syntax errors are a very common type of exception

#Division by Zero Error
#print(10*(1/0))

#Name Error:- Occures when a variable is called that has not been defined previously
#print(4+python*3)

#Type Error:- Occures when their is a mismatch of types in the program
#print('1'+1)

#Now handling these errors is a essential part of programming
#Below is a simple example for Revision

while True:
    try: # The try block is executed first
        x=int(input("Enter a number")) #If an exception occures here then we move to the except blocks
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("Not a value number Try again...")
print()
# A try clause can have multiple Except blocks but the downside is that only a single except block can run at any partciular point int time
# A Except handler bloack can also have multiple exceptions as shown below

    x=int(input("Hi please enter a number"))

# Exceptions also apply to classes, we can define a heirarchy of exceptions

class D(C):
    #A derived Class from C (And indirectly from B)

        #This block handles exceptions of type D
        # Since D is the most specific exception in the hierarchy, it will only catch instances of D.
        print("D")
    except C:
        # This block will handle exceptions of type C.
        # It also catches instances of any subclasses of C (like D),
        # but only if they weren't caught by a previous except block.

#When an exception occures it might have some associated values known as its Arguments 
# The except clause may specify a variable after the exception name. This variable is bount 
#to the exception instace which has an args attribute that stores the arguments.
# Built in exception types define a __str__() to print all the arguments

# We're raising an exception here with two messages: 'spam' and 'eggs'
try:
    raise Exception('spam', 'eggs')
except Exception as inst:
    # Print the type of the exception (it will show 'Exception')
    print(type(inst))  # Shows that it's an Exception
    
    # Print the details (arguments) of the exception
    print(inst.args)  # Will print the tuple ('spam', 'eggs')
    
    # This is the string version of the exception (itâ€™s automatically created)
    print(inst)  # This prints the message '('spam', 'eggs')'

    x, y = inst.args  # Unpacks the two values 'spam' and 'eggs'

#Except block as shown below

#Anouther Example of Chaining Exmaples

#except ConnectionError as exc: #Calling the exception as an alias
#    raise RuntimeError('Failed to open the database') from exc #Raise a secondary exception inside the original handle block for the exception

#We are also able to disable Automatic Exception Chaining by using the from None Idiom
